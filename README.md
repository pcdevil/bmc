# `bmc` - bootstrap my computer
A set of install and config commands to make os (re)installs more easy.

## Tasks
The entrypoint of the application is the [`Makefile`](Makefile), all available
feature is created as a task.

While some tasks use existing tools, such as [APT] or [Homebrew] to install the
required programs, others use [Git]'s clone command to achieve the appropriate
effect. For these tasks a `TARGET_DIR` environment variable is necessary to be
defined as the destination folder.
